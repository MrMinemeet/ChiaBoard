# ChiaBoard
CLI tool that displays stats similarly to the GUI version of chia


## Shown information
* Expected Time to Win
* Estimated NetSpace

* Plot Count
* Difficulty
* Network (eg. `mainnet`)
* Total Iterations since Blockchain start

## How to Build
Make sure you have [Go](https://go.dev/) installed.
For development, I currently use *1.18.1*.

To build the binary, simply execute the `build.sh` file, and you should get a `ChiaBoard` binary in the same directory.
